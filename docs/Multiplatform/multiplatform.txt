1. Processor Architecture   - just use Qt
2. Operating System         - just use Qt, cmake to generate platform-specific build files.
3. Build system		    - ninja is prefered (multiplatform build system)
4. Compiler                 - test on all compilers (GCC (MinGW), Clang, MSVC)
5. System Libraries         - statically link dependencies where possible
6. Third-Party Libraries    - choose widely supported libraries, embed code when possible

Testing:
    Use CI/CD pipelines to test on all target OS/architectures.
    GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
Packaging:
    Distributing platform-specific installers (e.g., .deb, .msi, .dmg).
    CPack, Inno Setup, or Snap/Flatpak.
