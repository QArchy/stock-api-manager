Libraries:
1. Eigen/Dense (Matrix/Linear Algebra)
	Overview:
		Eigen is a highly optimized, header-only C++ library for linear algebra, matrix and vector operations, and related numerical computations. The Dense module covers general-purpose dense matrices and arrays.
	Multiplatform Support:
		Eigen is designed to be portable and works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and other platforms. Its header-only nature means you only include the headers in your project.
	Optimization:
		Eigen leverages expression templates to optimize operations, often eliminating temporary objects. It also supports SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions and vectorized operations where available.
	
2. TA-Lib (Technical Indicators)
	Overview:
		TA-Lib is a widely used library that provides over 150 technical analysis functions, including moving averages, oscillators, and momentum indicators.
	Multiplatform Support:
		TA-Lib is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Precompiled binaries exist for some platforms, but it can also be built from source.
	Optimization:
		It is written in C and optimized for performance. You can integrate it with your C++ code, and its functions are often used in high-frequency trading applications.

3. Boost.Math/Boost.Accumulators (Statistical Functions)
	Overview:
		Boost.Math provides a wide range of mathematical functions and statistical distributions, while Boost.Accumulators offers tools for statistical aggregation (like calculating running means, variances, etc.).
	Multiplatform Support:
		Boost libraries are known for their portability and work across Windows, Linux, macOS, and many other systems.
	Optimization:
		Boost libraries are rigorously optimized and well-tested. Boost.Accumulators allows you to incrementally compute statistics in an efficient manner.

4. FFTW (Fourie, cycle detection in price data)
	Overview:
		FFTW is a C library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions. It’s widely regarded for its efficiency and adaptability.
	Multiplatform Support:
		FFTW is available on Linux, Windows, and macOS. It is open source and highly portable.
	Optimization:
		FFTW automatically tunes itself to the hardware to choose the fastest algorithm (via its “planner”). It also supports multi-threading and SIMD instructions.

5. OpenMP (Parallel processing)
	Overview:
		OpenMP is an API for multi-platform shared memory parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It allows you to add simple compiler directives to parallelize loops and sections of code.
	Multiplatform Support:
		OpenMP is supported by major compilers on Windows (e.g., MSVC), Linux (GCC, Clang), and macOS.
	Optimization:
		It allows you to easily parallelize computations to take advantage of multi-core CPUs. By splitting loops across threads, you can significantly speed up heavy computational tasks.

Optimizations:
1. SIMD Optimization
	Overview:
		SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) allows you to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously. Modern CPUs include SIMD instruction sets (e.g., SSE, AVX).
	Integration:
		Libraries like Eigen and FFTW automatically leverage SIMD instructions. You can also write custom SIMD code using compiler intrinsics or libraries such as Intel’s IPP or the Boost.SIMD library.
	Benefits:
		This can lead to significant performance improvements in numerical computations, especially in vector and matrix operations.

2. Cache-Friendly Data Layout
	Overview:
		Optimizing data layout to be cache-friendly means organizing your data in memory so that it fits well into CPU caches. This reduces cache misses and speeds up memory access.
	Techniques:
		Contiguous Memory Allocation:
			Use data structures like std::vector or Eigen’s matrices that store data contiguously.
		Structure of Arrays vs. Array of Structures (SoA vs. AoS):
			For certain applications, organizing data in a structure of arrays can be more cache-friendly than an array of structures.
		Data Alignment:
			Aligning data to cache line boundaries (often 64 bytes) can also improve performance. Many libraries (like Eigen) handle alignment automatically.
	Benefits:
		Faster memory access speeds and overall improved performance in data-intensive computations.
